## 🌸 **Overview**

This project explores **consumer shopping behavior** in a clean, visual, and insight-driven way.
Think of it as:

> *“What influences people to buy? How do spending patterns shift? Who are the high-value customers?”*

We turn raw data → meaningful patterns → aesthetic visualizations.
